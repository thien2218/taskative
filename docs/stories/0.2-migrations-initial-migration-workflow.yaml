story:
  role: "developer"
  action: "to generate and apply the initial Prisma migration for the core models"
  benefit: "the database can be reliably created and evolved via a standard workflow."
acceptance-criteria:
  - "Initial migration is generated from `src/db/schema.prisma` and applies cleanly on a fresh database. [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#workflows]"
  - "Local commands exist and are documented to: (a) generate dev migrations and (b) apply migrations (dev/apply). [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#scope]"
  - "Applying the migration produces the expected tables and indexes consistent with Section 3 reference SQL. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md]"
  - "The workflow is captured in repository scripts or docs (e.g., `db:migrate:create`, `db:migrate:apply`). [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#scope]"

  -  [x] Generate initial migration from `src/db/schema.prisma`. (AC: 1) [Diff: 6]
     -  [x] Verify a fresh D1 database applies the migration without errors. (AC: 1) [Diff: 3]
     -  [x] Confirm tables and indexes match the intent of Section 3. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md] [Diff: 3]
  -  [x] Add or verify scripts/commands for migration dev and apply (e.g., `db:migrate:create`, `db:migrate:apply`). (AC: 2, 4) [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#scope] [Diff: 6]
  -  [x] Document the migration workflow steps in repo docs (README or docs note). (AC: 4) [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#workflows] [Diff: 6]

  ### Platform and Tech Stack
  
  -  Workers on Cloudflare with D1 as the relational store; Prisma governs schema changes. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.1-purpose]
  
  ### Prisma Enforcement
  
  -  Use Prisma CLI for migration operations; do not edit SQL directly. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#important-—-prisma-enforcement]
  
  ### Project Structure / File Locations
  
  -  Prisma schema at `backend/src/db/schema.prisma` [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.2-folder-structure]
  -  Migrations output in `backend/src/db/migrations/`
  -  Add repo scripts (e.g., in `backend/package.json`) for `db:migrate:create` and `db:migrate:apply`
  
  ### Testing Requirements
  
  No explicit testing strategy doc; validate via fresh DB apply and smoke checks on resulting tables.

  ### Review Date: 2025-08-12
  
  ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)
  
  ### Code Quality Assessment
  
  -  Initial migration `20250812144018_initial_migration` creates tables, FKs, and indexes that match the Prisma schema and Section 3 SQL.
  -  Repository scripts include `db:migrate:create` and `db:migrate:apply`; paths and structure under `backend/src/db/migrations/` are correct.
  
  ### Refactoring Performed
  
  -  None.
  
  ### Compliance Check
  
  -  Coding Standards: ✓
  -  Project Structure: ✓
  -  Testing Strategy: N/A (validated via migration apply in Dev Agent Record)
  -  All ACs Met: ✓
  
  ### Improvements Checklist
  
  -  [x] Optionally add a `db:migrate:reset` script for fresh local resets.
  
  ### Security Review
  
  -  N/A (schema/migration only).
  
  ### Performance Considerations
  
  -  Indices on `tasks` and `reminders` look appropriate for expected queries.
  
  ### Final Status
  
  -  ✓ Approved - Ready for Done
