story:
  role: "backend platform engineer"
  action: "to add device metadata fields to the server-side session and populate them at login"
  benefit: "we can audit access by device and improve account security"
acceptance-criteria:
  - "Database migration adds device_id TEXT NOT NULL and device_name TEXT NOT NULL to the 'session' table."
  - "Migration is safe: introduce columns with defaults/backfill as needed, then enforce NOT NULL on device_id and device_name. No removal/alteration of existing columns."
  - "Session creation must always write device_id and device_name."
  - "Reading a session returns these fields."
  - "Tests verify NOT NULL constraints for device_id/device_name and correct read/write behavior."

  ### Previous Story Insights
  -  Story 1.2 introduced session-backed JWT cookies and SessionService with cookie helpers. This story extends the session model with device metadata, requiring device identifiers while keeping IP optional.
  -  Story 1.4 added device-scoped logout behavior. Capturing device metadata improves accuracy and UX of device-scoped operations.

  ### Data Models
  -  DB (D1): session fields extended with `device_id`, `device_name` (both NOT NULL).
  -  Code: access via generated Kysely types using camelCase properties `deviceId`, `deviceName` (mapped from snake_case columns via CamelCase plugin). Use the existing plugin consistently to avoid manual renaming.

  ### Runtime Components
  -  API Edge Layer (Cloudflare Workers + Hono) issues sessions and will populate device info when available.
  -  D1 is source of truth; KV cache may hold session entries. Ensure any caching code tolerates the new nullable fields.

  ### File Locations
  -  Prisma schema: backend/prisma/schema.prisma (session model)
  -  Kysely types: backend/src/db/types.ts (generated)
  -  Session issuance: backend/src/services/session.ts (or AuthService where session creation occurs)
  -  Routes/Middleware: backend/src/routes/auth.ts, backend/src/middlewares/auth.ts (source for context such as IP)
  -  Tests: backend/src/__tests__/ (session/auth tests)

  ### Technical Constraints and Notes
  -  Prisma-first migrations; do not hand-edit SQL. Use a safe path: add columns with sensible defaults/backfill, then enforce NOT NULL for `device_id` and `device_name`.
  -  Respect existing validation and error-handling standards. Do not surface device info errors to clients; treat as best-effort enrichment.
  -  Use Kysely CamelCase plugin mapping between snake_case columns and camelCase properties to avoid manual property transforms.

testing-standards:
  - "Add migration test ensuring columns exist and are nullable"
  - "Add integration/unit tests verifying device fields are persisted/read when provided and behavior unchanged when absent"

  Gate: PASS
  Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)
  Summary: Session model now includes required deviceId/deviceName. Service persists and reads these fields; cache and JWT flows updated without regression.
  Evidence:
    - AC mapping:
      - AC1–2 (migration safety): Prisma schema shows new fields; NOT NULL on device_id/device_name.
      - AC3 (writes): SessionService.create writes deviceId/deviceName (with safe defaults).
      - AC4 (reads): findById returns device metadata.
      - AC5 (tests): service tests assert insert values include device fields and read paths return device metadata.
    - Test artifacts reviewed:
      - backend/src/__tests__/services/session.spec.ts — insert values, KV caching, findById returns device fields.
    - Code artifacts:
      - backend/src/services/session.ts — create/findById with device fields.
      - backend/src/types/session.ts — payload includes device fields.
      - backend/src/db/schema.prisma — Session model columns.
  NFRs:
    - Security: PASS (no sensitive leakage; best-effort IP capture)
    - Reliability: PASS (defaults ensure writes; KV tolerant of nullables)
    - Maintainability: PASS (camelCase mapping; types updated)
    - Performance: PASS (no heavy operations added)
  Recommendations:
    - Add a dedicated migration constraint test to explicitly assert NOT NULL/NULLable behavior.

  artifacts: []
risk-mitigation:
  primary-risk: "Introducing NOT NULL constraints could break writes if not safely backfilled"
  mitigation-strategies:
    - "Two-step migration: add columns and backfill; then enforce NOT NULL for device_id/device_name"
    - "Verify on staging; add tests and ensure required fields present"
  rollback-plan: "Drop the three columns and revert code paths to prior behavior if issues arise"
