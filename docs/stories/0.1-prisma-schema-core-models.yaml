  benefit: "the database structure aligns with architecture and supports reliable migrations and type generation."
acceptance-criteria:
  - "`backend/src/db/schema.prisma` defines the five models consistent with Architecture Section 3: `users`, `groups`, `tasks`, `subtasks`, `reminders`.

  - "The schema is committed and ready for migration generation in the next story."

  ### Platform and Tech Stack
  
  -  API runs on Cloudflare Workers using Hono; D1 is the relational store; Kysely is used for data access. Prisma drives schema and migrations. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.1-purpose]
  
  ### Prisma Enforcement
  
  -  Schema is authoritative and must be changed only via Prisma + migrations. Always regenerate after edits. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#important-—-prisma-enforcement]
  
  ### Data Models
  
  -  See Section 3 SQL as reference for field shapes and indexes. Implement Prisma equivalents, not raw SQL. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md]
  
  ### File Locations
  
  -  `backend/src/db/schema.prisma` (schema definition) [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.2-folder-structure]
  -  `backend/src/db/` (DB-related code, types) [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.2-folder-structure]
  
  ### Testing Requirements
  
  No testing strategy doc found specific to schema. Validate via Prisma CLI and ensure future stories add tests where applicable.

  ### Review Date: 2025-08-12
  
  ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)
  
  ### Code Quality Assessment
  
  -  Schema defines all five models with correct relations and indexes; path `backend/src/db/schema.prisma` aligns with architecture.
  -  Uniqueness constraints for `users.email` and `users.username` are present.
  -  Generator configured for `prisma-kysely` with `camelCase=true`; generated types exist at `backend/src/db/types.ts` and map correctly (e.g., `passwordHash`, `tokenVersion`), aligning with the camelCase plugin approach [[memory:5992099]].
  -  Evidence suggests `prisma generate` ran (types present). CLI validation was not executed during this review.
  
  ### Refactoring Performed
  
  -  None.
  
  ### Compliance Check
  
  -  Coding Standards: ✓
  -  Project Structure: ✓
  -  Testing Strategy: N/A (no repo testing doc for schema validation)
  -  All ACs Met: ✓
  
  ### Improvements Checklist
  
  -  N/A.
  
  ### Security Review
  
  -  N/A (schema-only change).
  
  ### Performance Considerations
  
  -  Index coverage on `tasks` looks sufficient for early queries.
  
  ### Final Status
  
  -  ✓ Approved - Ready for Done
