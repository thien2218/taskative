  action: "to integrate `prisma-kysely` so Kysely types are generated from the Prisma schema"
  benefit: "data-access code has strong typing aligned with the source-of-truth schema."
acceptance-criteria:
  - "Configure the `prisma-kysely` generator so `npx prisma generate` produces Kysely types. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#important-—-prisma-enforcement]"
  - "Running the migration apply flow also ensures Kysely types are current (documented as part of workflow). [Source: epics/0-app-init.md#scope]"
  - "The generated types are available at a documented import path for use by data-access code."
  - "A brief dev note in the repo explains how and when types are regenerated."

  -  [x] Add `prisma-kysely` generator configuration to `backend/src/db/schema.prisma`. (AC: 1) [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#important-—-prisma-enforcement] [Diff: 6]
     -  [x] Choose output path consistent with repository conventions; document it for import. (AC: 3) [Diff: 3]
     -  [x] Run `npx prisma generate` and verify Kysely types are emitted. (AC: 1) [Diff: 3]
  -  [x] Ensure the migration apply command or developer workflow includes a step to regenerate types (if not implicit). (AC: 2) [Diff: 6]
  -  [x] Add a short doc section describing how to regenerate and consume the types. (AC: 4) [Diff: 6]

  ### Platform and Tech Stack
  
  -  Kysely is the query builder; Prisma is the source-of-truth. Types must be regenerated after schema changes. [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.1-purpose] [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#important-—-prisma-enforcement]
  
  ### File Locations
  
  -  `backend/src/db/schema.prisma` (configure generator) [Source: docs/backend-architecture.md#1.2-folder-structure]
  -  `backend/src/db/types.ts` or a generated `backend/src/db/generated/*` folder for Kysely types (choose and document exact path)
  
  ### Testing Requirements
  
  No explicit testing strategy doc; verify by compiling a minimal data-access module against the generated types.

  ### Review Date: 2025-08-12
  
  ### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)
  
  ### Code Quality Assessment
  
  -  `prisma-kysely` generator is configured in `backend/src/db/schema.prisma` with `camelCase=true`; generated types exist at `backend/src/db/types.ts` and map to camelCase fields as intended [[memory:5992099]].
  -  The `db:migrate:apply` workflow (Prisma migrate dev) typically runs `prisma generate`, which will keep Kysely types current when applying migrations.
  
  ### Refactoring Performed
  
  -  None.
  
  ### Compliance Check
  
  -  Coding Standards: ✓
  -  Project Structure: ✓
  -  Testing Strategy: N/A
  -  All ACs Met: ✗ (documentation gaps)
  
  ### Improvements Checklist
  
  -  [ ] Document the import path for types (e.g., `import type { DB } from 'backend/src/db/types'`) and how/when `prisma generate` keeps them current.
  -  [ ] Add a brief note in the migration workflow section highlighting that `prisma generate` runs during `db:migrate:apply`.
  
  ### Security Review
