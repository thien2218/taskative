status: "Draft"
priority: null
story:
  role: "backend platform engineer"
  action: "to introduce a minimal structured logging service compatible with Cloudflare Workers, enabling easy integration and debugging"
  benefit: "we get consistent JSON logs and simpler debugging in Workers without Node-only APIs"

acceptance-criteria:
  - "Works in Cloudflare Workers runtime (no Node-only APIs) and validates under wrangler dev."
  - "Supports log levels: debug, info, warn, error."
  - "Emits structured JSON with keys: ts (ISO-8601), level, message, context (object)."
  - "Allows injecting request context (e.g., cf-ray or x-request-id) when provided."
  - "Configurable pretty-print for local dev and compact JSON for production via a flag/env binding."
  - "Safe serialization that avoids throwing on circular data; fallback to stringification."

tasks-subtasks: |
  - [ ] Implement minimal logger wrapper with level gating and JSON formatter (AC: 2, 3) [Diff: 3]
    - [ ] Detect Workers environment and avoid Node-specific globals (AC: 1) [Diff: 1]
  - [ ] Add request context injection helper (AC: 4) [Diff: 2]
  - [ ] Toggle pretty/compact modes via config/env (AC: 5) [Diff: 2]
  - [ ] Write checks using wrangler dev to confirm runtime compatibility (AC: 1) [Diff: 3]

dev-notes: |
  ### Previous Story Insights
  - Prior stories focused on DI and session improvements; this adds minimal structured logging compatible with Workers.

  ### Runtime Components
  - API Edge (Cloudflare Workers + Hono) uses console.* and env bindings; no Node fs/process.

  ### File Locations
  - TBD: backend logging utility and Worker integration points.

  ### Technical Constraints and Notes
  - Cloudflare Workers runtime only; avoid Node-only APIs; ensure safe serialization.

testing-standards:
  - "Include tests for level gating, JSON shape, and context injection."
  - "Verify behavior in wrangler dev; avoid Node-only APIs."

test-specs:
  specs:
    - "1: [AC 1] Given a Worker handler with the logger, When emitting at each level, Then logs are produced without runtime errors in wrangler dev."
    - "2: [AC 3] Given context object, When logging, Then output includes ts, level, message, and context keys."
  artifacts: []

risk-mitigation:
  primary-risk: "Unexpected runtime incompatibility or excessive log volume in production"
  mitigation-strategies:
    - "Validate in wrangler dev and stage before enabling in production"
    - "Default to info level; allow level override via binding"
  rollback-plan: "Disable or lower log level via configuration and remove logger initialization"
